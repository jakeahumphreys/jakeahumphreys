### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jake, A .Net Software Developer with a degree in Software Engineering. I currently develop point of sale solutions and maintain finance calculations for large automotive manufacturers.

## ðŸ”§ Iâ€™m currently working on / have worked on recently
- A Productivity app that will feature Task Managament, Notes, Timers & More written in Blazor/WPF [Yapa](https://github.com/jakeahumphreys/Yapa)
  - I tend to have some flavour of task management app on the go, I'm obsessed with the things
- A Simplistic Youtube video downloader / converter written in Blazor/WPF [YtDownloader](https://github.com/jakeahumphreys/YtDownloader)
- [MClock](https://github.com/jakeahumphreys/MClock), a continuation of a work day utility created by a colleague

## Looking for some photino Templates?
I use Photino *a lot* and usually with MudBlazor. Rather than constantly recreating the same boilerplate every time I spin up a new project, I've created some templates. Find them [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/JTemplates)

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jake, A .Net Software Developer with a degree in Software Engineering. I currently develop point of sale solutions and maintain finance calculations for large automotive manufacturers.

## ðŸ”§ Iâ€™m currently working on
- A companion app for Elden Ring written in Blazor/MAUI Hybrid using the amazing [Elden Ring API](https://docs.eldenring.fanapis.com/)
  - This will need porting to Blazor WPF, MAUI is just too slow in its current format and I don't even need the android components.
- A Productivity app that will feature Task Managament, Notes, Timers & More written in Blazor/WPF [Tapp](https://github.com/jakeahumphreys/Tapp)
- A Simplistic Youtube video downloader / converter written in Blazor/WPF [YtDownloader](https://github.com/jakeahumphreys/YtDownloader)
- [MClock](https://github.com/jakeahumphreys/MClock), a continuation of a work day utility created by a colleague
